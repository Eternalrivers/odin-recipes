Project: Recipes

The project is about creating an html document using the knowledge about HTML Foundations.

It will demonstrate basic knowledge about creating an HTML boilerplate, the basic HTML elements as well as attaching pictures with its corresponding links.

p.s Project was already completed in a separate repo. As I can now access port 22 of the internet, copied contents from that repo and will submit using the required repository.
